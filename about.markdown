# Who We Are

Team ARAM is a cross-institutional research group focusing on **A**nimation, **R**obotics, **A**nd **M**achine Learning, led by [Nam Hee Gordon Kim](https://namheegordonkim.github.io). Team ARAM is a platform for peer-to-peer collaboration aiming for cutting edge research in embodied intelligence.

<!-- as these happen to be the shared interests among the current members. However, we wish to honour the spirit of the acronym's true origin--<a href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/es/wiki/ARAM">All Random All Mid</a>, where collaboration and synergy is the key to success, people of diverse backgrounds and disciplines find their places, and genuine moments of fun, curiosity, and hilarity drive the atmosphere. -->

<!-- Team ARAM is a counter-culture movement to the prevalent lone-wolfism of the post-COVID academia, founded to promote and facilitate a collaborative research environment for researchers of all levels (BSc/MSc/PhD/postdoc/faculty) in quantitative disciplines. -->
