            <h1>Interested in joining us?</h1>
            <p>
                We are looking for strongly motivated and enthusiastic students to join our research group.
                Please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/hwvezChwatdHZ15k9">this form</a>, and we will reach out to you.
            </p>
            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <h3>How many hours per week do I need to commit?</h3>
            <p>
                We have 1.5 hours of weekly group meeting on Tuesday mornings, and there are project-specific "whirlwind meetings" that happen according to the schedule agreed by participants (usually 1 hour per week).
                We are seeking members who will commit to the Tuesday morning meeting as well as at least one whirlwind meeting (e.g. their own project), hence there is around 2.5 hours minimum of required meeting times.
            </p>
            <h3>Will I get paid for doing projects with you?</h3>
            <p>
                This depends on the topic and the scope.
                Some thesis students may be subject to thesis worker stipends based on advisors' recommendation and agreement with a supervising Aalto faculty.
                Other students are encouraged to apply for scholarships as needed. Our members are happy to provide support through the process.
            </p>
            <h3>I am not an Aalto University student. Can I still join?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, you can. You don't need to be an Aalto student to join us.
                However, our physical meetings happen on Aalto University premises and we strongly prefer that our members within Helsinki area gather in person.
                For members joining from remote locations, we always have a Zoom session at our  group meetings with teleconference equipment.
            </p>
            <h3>I am already supervised by a faculty. Why should I join?</h3>
            <p>
                Our research group welcomes all researchers regardless of whether they're tied to a supervisor, provided that they can still participate in group meetings and mentorship engagements.
                We are more than happy to supplement peer advising <em>if</em> your already existing research group does not provide sufficient support.
            </p>
            <h3>How does co-authorship work in Team ARAM?</h3>
            <p>
                We strongly encourage thesis students to aim to publish; depending on the amount of experiment and writing support necessary, an advisor may share the first co-authorship (for example, full-time hours spent for several weeks).
                Otherwise, the student is to be the well-earned first author, with advisors listed as secondary co-authors.
