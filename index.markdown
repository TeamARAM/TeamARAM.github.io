We are a research group focusing on machine learning and optimization techniques for motion control and character animation problems, altogether comprising the domain of embodied artificial intelligence. Our research topics currently span:

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>
Simulated Robotics 路 Reinforcement Learning 路 Generative Models 路  Digital Humans 路 Optimization
</i></p>

<!-- ## Research Objectives

We tackle physics-based character animation challenges using robotics techniques involving planning and learned control and kinematic motion modeling problems with generative models. The two domains intertwine -->

<!-- ### What is Embodied Intelligence?

### Motion Emergence via Navigating Physical Environments

### Modeling Motor Skill Inheritance -->

## Announcements

- Prospective research mentees are encouraged to sign up [here](/joinus-autumn2024/)
- Autumn 2024 information session will be held in late August, exact date TBD.

## Meeting Schedule

Meeting slides are made available in members-only calendar invites.
